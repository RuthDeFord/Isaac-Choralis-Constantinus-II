<h3>Mensurations and proportions</h3>

The mensuration of the great majority of the separate sections of pieces in <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> is ₵.
 It is not always signed explicitly, but it is assumed if no sign is present.<p>

<h4>Other signs, excluding <i>sesquialtera</i> proportion</h4>

Signs that apply to all voices throughout a section:<p>

<ul><li>Ϲ: Sequence 9, v. 4; also incorrect Ϲ (for ₵) in Sequence 7, v. 2 (D, A, T)</li>
<li>Օ2: Sequence 8, v. 6; Introit 25, verse</li>
<li>Օ: Introit 25, antiphon</li>
<li>Φ: Tract 4, verse 4; Sequence 7, v. 18; Sequence 8, v. 4; Sequence 8, v. 18; Sequence 9, v. 10;
 Sequence 10, v. 2; Sequence 23, v. 22</li></ul><p>

Simultaneous change of signs in all voices within a section:<p>

<ul><li>Ͼ → Φ: Sequence 3, v. 14</li></ul><p>

Combinations of mensurations that apply throughout a section:<p>

<ul><li>₵ + ₵2 (duple proportion): Introit 24, antiphon; Sequence 10, v. 12</li>
<li>₵ + Ϲ (subduple proportion): Introit 24, verse; Sequence 12, v. 8</li>
<li>Օ + Ꙩ (subduple proportion; mensuration canon): Sequence 9, v. 2</li>
<li>Օ + Ͼ (subduple proportion): Sequence 24, v. 2</li>
<li>Φ + cut-Ͼ (printed incorrectly as ₵; subduple proportion): Introit 14, verse</li></ul><p>

Combinations of mensurations and proportions that change within a section:<p>

<ul><li>Ϲ (D, A, T) + Ͼ (B) → all Ͼ → all Ϲ: Sequence 13, v. 2</li>
<li>₵ (D, A, T) + ₵ → 2 → 4 (B): Alleluia 25</li>
<li>₵ (D, A, T) + Օ → Ϲ → ₵ → 2/1 → 4/1 (B): Sequence 1, v. 8</li>
<li>₵ (all) → coloration (all) → Φ + cut-Ɔ + Ϲ + Օ: Tract 5, v. 6</li>
<li>₵ (all) → ₵2 + Ϲ2 + cut-Ɔ → 4 + cut-Ɔ + Ϲ: Sequence 14, v. 20</li>
<li>8 different combinations of most of the above signs and the unique ₵Ɔ: Sequence 25, v. 2</li>  See
 <a href="../Sources/Treatises/Heyden_Musica.html">Heyden, <i>Musicae</i></a> for a discussion
 of these signs.</ul><p>

<h4><i>Sesquialtera</i> proportion</h4>

<i>Sesquialtera</i> proportion is of two types: groups of three semibreves and groups of three minims.<p>

<ul><li>The signs of semibreve <i>sesquialtera</i> are ₵3 (mostly at beginnings of sections), 3 (mostly within
 sections), Օ2/3 (Sequence 4, v. 7 only), Օ/3 (Sequence 9, v. 10 only), and coloration.</li>
<li>The signs of minim <i>sesquialtera</i> are 3 and coloration.</li></ul><p>

Semibreve <i>sesquialtera</i> is very common.  It is found mostly within sections in ₵ (at the beginning,
 middle, or end), but sometimes throughout a section.  It almost always appears in all voices simultaneously.
 It is in simultaneous combination with ₵ only in the following sections:<p>

<ul><li>Simultaneous with rests in ₵: Sequence 1, v. 10; Sequence 2, v. 6; Sequnece 23, v. 16</li>
<li>Simultaneous with notes in ₵: Sequence 2, v. 8; Sequence 8, v. 14; Sequence 8, v. 20
 (overlap resulting from the notation of the canon); Sequence 19, v. 24; Sequence 20, v. 20</li></ul><p>

Minim <i>sesquialtera</i> is much less common than semibreve <i>sesquialtera</i>. It appears in the
 following contexts:<p>

<ul><li>In all voices in the concluding passage of a section: Communion 8; Sequence 13, v. 2; Sequence 19,
 v. 18; Sequence 21, v. 10</li>
 <li>In a very brief passage in single voice, combined with ₵: Communion 10; Tract 4, v. 2</li>
 <li>In extended passages, combined with numerous other signs: Sequence 25, v. 2</li></ul>
