<p><b>Source of pieces in <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>:</b></p>

 <i>Choralis Constantinus I</i> is based on sources from Munich that contain Imperial
 repertoire transmitted to Munich by Ludwig Senfl.  That repertoire includes three
 pieces that are also found in the Constance set, all with different liturgical
 assignmens.  The surviving set of Munich manuscripts is incomplete and covers
 only the period from Advent through Lent; it includes Communion 5, but not the
 other pieces shared by <i>Choralis I</i> and <i>Choralis II</i>.</p>

Although the borrowing from one of these repertoires to the other
 could conceivably have happened in either direction, it is most likely that the
 shared pieces originated in the Constance repertoire and were then incorporated
 retroactively into the Imperial repertoire.  This hypothesis is supported by both
 musical and liturgical arguments.  The Constance liturgical assignments are more
 standard and more logical, especially in the case of Communion 14, which is
 specifically applicable to Mary Magdalen, but has no relation to the 22nd Sunday
 after Pentecost.  The musical styles of the numbers also match the style of the
 Constance repertoire, not that of the Imperial repertoire.</p>
