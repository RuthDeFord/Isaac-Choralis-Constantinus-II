<p><b>Character of the <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> example:</b><p>

Glarean added text to Heyden's originally textless example.  Since he did not know that Isaac set only
 even-numbered verses of sequences, he mistakenly applied the words of the first, rather than the
 second, verse of the chant to the example.  He commented disapprovingly on the complexity of the notation.<p>

In both the original notation and the resolution, Glarean substitutes 3/2 for Heyden's 3/1.<p>

Glarean must have derived his example from Heyden's <i>Musicae</i>, since he has correct readings in the
 three places where <i>De arte canendi</i> has errors.  He corrected the errors in m. 4 of the original
and mm. 2 and 15 of the resolution.<p>

Recognizing the errors in both the original and the resolution of the bass in m. 18 in <i>Musicae</i>,
 Glarean recomposed the
 measure in both of his versions.  In his resolution, the measure reads g g a d
 (breve-semibreve-semibreve-breve) in 3/2.  The third g in Heyden's example is changed to a to make it
 compatible with the other voices.  In his version of the original, Glarean notated the measure in 12/2
 proportion with values four times as long as those in the resolution, probably in response to Heyden's
 notation of the measure in 4/1 proportion with <i>sesquialtera</i> in three of the voices.<p>

Glarean's example has one error that is not in either of Heyden's versions: tenor, m. 12 n. 5 of the
 resolution, is a semibreve, rather than a breve.<p>
