Zacconi also mentions or shows examples from three pieces that could be from <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>,
 but do not appear in that source where he says that they are. They may be from other settings of the same chants by Isaac.

<ul><li>"Alleluia della dedicatione del tempio" is said to illustrate a half-black long (fol. 32v-33r).</li>
<li>Example of a black breve-breve ligature plus semibreve is said to be from "Sidus radio sequenza della Pasqua"
 (fol. 42v). The notes do not appear in the Mass 6 sequence or verse 6 of the Mass 2 sequence, which includes the
 words "sidus radio."</li>
<li>Example from "Alleluia della Pentecoste" (fol. 192r) illustrates dots of alteration and perfection.</li></ul>

<p><b>Character of the <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> examples:</b><p>

All of Zacconi's examples are short excerpts.  All but one show only one voice.<p>

The examples serve as illustrations of notational principles.  Two of them differ slightly from the print.

<ul><li>Mass 2, Sequence, v. 6: unnecessary and undesirable coloration. The example has a different clef from the
 one in the <i>Choralis</i> print and a flat signature not in the print. The last few pitches differ from the print.</li>
<li>Mass 2, Sequence, v. 12: coloration used to prevent perfection and alteration of semibreves.</li>
<li>Mass 3, Sequence, v. 14: perfect prolation including white flagged minims and semiminims.</li>
<li>Mass 6, Communion: unnecessary coloration.</li>
<li>Mass 10, Sequence, v. 4: incorrect imperfect breve (which should have been an altered semibreve) before another
 breve. Zacconi misinterprets a breve in the print as part of the preceding ligature and states
on that basis that the ligature is incorrect.</li>
<li>Mass 11, Sequence, v. 14: correct notation of a black breve + black long in ligature.</li>
<li>Mass 13, Sequence, v. 22: proportion of inequality of <i>tactus</i> and figures. Zacconi adds the sign
 Ã˜2/3 that is not in the print. He attributes the example to Obrecht and says incorrectly that the voice
 is the A.</li>
<li>Mass 18, Introit: unnecessary and undesirable coloration.</li></ul>
