<p><b>Character of the <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> examples:</b><p>

The examples are without text. Both have complex proportional notation probably devised by Heyden.<p>

In the Mass 14 example, the sign in the bass in m. 16 and the tenor in m. 20 is Ɔ, rather than
 cut-Ɔ, as in the <i>Choralis</i> print.  Since Ɔ is the sign that 
 would have been expected in Isaac's usual notation, and it is the sign in
 <a href="../Manuscripts/H-Bn_Bartfa_8_and_24.html">H-Bn MS Bártfa 8</a>, it appears that Heyden
 changed it to cut-Ɔ in the exemplar for the print when he realized
 (belatedly) that the Ɔ in his treatise did not agree with his theory.<p>

The Mass 25 example and its resolution are nearly the same as in Heyden's
 <a href="Heyden_Musica.html"><i>Musicae</i></a>, except that the errors have been corrected.  The sign 4/1
 in the bass in m. 18 is interpreted consistently as if it were 8/1.  The variant rhythm in the resolution
 of the alto, m. 14, is retained.<p>

 Three new errors are added in the resolution:<p>

<ul><li>T, m. 8 n. 2: note is missing.</li>
   <li>T, m. 11 n. 8: pitch is c'.</li>
   <li>T, m. 18, the sign 2/1 is missing.</li></ul>
