<h3>The <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> Print</h3>

<p><b>Heinrich, Isaac, <i>Tomus Secundus Choralis Constantini</i><br>
(Nuremberg: Hieronymus Formschneider, 1555).</b></p>

<p>The second volume of a three-volume set.  Volume I was published in 1550 and volumes II
 and III in 1555.  The second and third volumes were produced together, with the
 dedication and publication information applying to both of them.  The dedication,
 to Johann Jacob Fugger, is signed by the Augsburg book dealer Georg Willer, who
 purchased the materials for the print from Ott's widow in 1554.</p>

<p>4 partbooks (discantus, altus, tenor, bassus).</p>

<p>Facsimile edition, ed. Edward R. Lerner (Peer: Alamire, 1992).</p>

<p>Modern edition, ed. Anton Webern, Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich
 16/i (Vienna: Österreichischer Bundesverlag, 1909).</p>

<p>The print was checked, and a number of errors were corrected by hand, before the book was
released for sale.  <a href="In-house_corrections.html">In-house corrections</a> can be identified by the fact that they appear in
all, or nearly all, copies of the print.  They apply only to the music (notes, rhythms, clefs,
key signatures, accidentals, and mensuration signs), not to the texts.  Despite the printer's efforts, many
errors remained uncorrected.</p> 

<p>The texts are treated much more carelessly than the music in the print.  Text placement is
imprecise, and often simply incorrect.  Errors of word choice, spelling, and grammar are common.<p>

<p>There is a very brief <a href="Errata.html">errata sheet</a>, which lists only two errors (both in volume II),
 at the end of the tenor partbook of volume III.  Some copies of the print mark these errors by hand on the
 pages where they occur.</p>

<p><a href="Print_copies.html">Twelve complete or partial copies of the print survive today.</a>
Some of them have handwritten annotations other than in-house corrections that reveal
evidence of practical issues faced by the performers.</p>
