<b>Sources of pieces in <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>:</b></p>

Introit 1 (verse only) was probably copied from RISM 1545<sup>5</sup> or a copy of it, since it joins Isaac's
 verse with a different antiphon from RISM 1545<sup>5</sup>.   Alleluia 1 shares a distinctive variant with
 RISM 1545<sup>5</sup>, and is probably traceable to the same source. 
 Alleluia 14 and Sequence 14, which appear as a pair under the label of "Sequentia,"
 appear to be descended from pre-print copies in the Nuremberg line (see below).</p>

<p><b>Character of variants in <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> repertoire:</b></p>

Verse 20 of the Sequence 14 features a complex array of signs of duple, quadruple, and subduple proportions.
 These signs were probably imposed on Isaac's notation by Sebald Heyden in the course of editing
 the music for the print.  D-LEu MS Thomaskirche 49 has a reversed semicircle in the bass in m. 16 and the
 tenor in m. 20.  These are the signs that appear in <a href="H-Bn_Bartfa_8_and_24.html">H-Bn MS Bártfa Mus.8</a> and
 <a href="../Treatises/Heyden_Musica.html">Heyden's Musicae</a>.  They are
 replaced in the <i>Choralis</i> print with cut versions of the sign, probably because Heyden realized
 after the publication of his treatise that the signs he had used there did not agree with his theory.
 This detail suggests that the sequence in D-LEu MS Thomaskirche 49 was copied from a manuscript based
 on a pre-print source in the Nuremberg line.  D-LEu MS Thomaskirche 49 also includes a resolution in
 cut-C of the passage with the complex notation.</p> 

The verse of Alleluia 14 has a rhythmic variant in mm. 10-14 that makes the passage one semibreve longer
 than it is in the print (by replacing two minims with semibreves in the D and extending rests in the other
 voices). The major cadences and the end of the piece are misaligned with the breve <i>initia</i> in all
 other sources from m. 14 on. Similar misalignments occur occasionally
 in other Isaac verses. The print version is therefore not necessarily incorrect, but someone in the course
 of transmission of the piece apparently felt that the anomaly required  correction.</p>
