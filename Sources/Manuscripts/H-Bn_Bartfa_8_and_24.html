<h3>H-Bn MS Bártfa Mus.8 and H-Bn MS Bártfa Mus.24</h3>

Budapest, National Széchényi Lbrary, MS Bártfa 8 (hereeafter ms. 8)</br>
Budapest, National Széchényi Lbrary, MS Bártfa 24 (hereafter ms. 24)</p>

Two closely related collections of liturgical music</p>

Four partbooks each: D, A, T, B.  Both manuscripts heavily damaged and restored, 
with some pages missing and some portions illegible owing to water damage.</p>

<b>Provenance:</b> Copied for the church of St. Aegidius in Bártfa (Bardejov).</p>

<b>Published catalogue:</b> Róbert Árpád Murányi. <i>Thematisches Verzeichnis der
 Musiksammlung von Bartfeld (Bártfa).</i>  Bonn, 1991.  Muranyi [p.XXIII] dates the
 manuscript after 1555 on grounds of the incorrect assumption  that it was copied from
 the <i>Choralis</i> print (see below).</p>

DIAMM entries: <a href="https://www.diamm.ac.uk/sets/100/"target="_blank">Ms. 8</a>
 <a href="https://www.diamm.ac.uk/sets/95/"target="_blank">Ms. 24</a></p>

<b><i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> contents:</b></p>

Each manuscript consists of two unrelated sections with separate origins,
 the second designated “Koll. 2" in Murányi.  The core of the first section,
 which contains the <i>Choralis II</i> music, is a set of mass propers (excluding communions)
 for high feasts throughout the year interspersed with mass ordinary settings.
 Ms. 24 also includes a section of introits for Septuagesima through Passion Sunday.</p>

All but two of the propers for the high feasts except Transfiguration and Angels
 are from either <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> or the Trinity mass in <i>Choralis
 Constantinus I</i>, which was originally part of the <i>Choralis II</i> repertoire.
 Ms. 24 includes 23 numbers for 10 feasts from <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>; ms. 8 includes all but one of them.</p>

Despite their similarity of content, the two manuscripts differ significantly
 in organization and presentation.  Ms. 24 is slightly larger (28x20 cm., in
 contrast to 17x23 for ms. 8).  Its opening section is systematically organized.
 It begins, after three introductory responses, with music for 19 masses in
 liturgical order: Advent [presumably the 4th Sunday], Christmas, Epiphany,
 Purification, 6 masses for Septuagesima through Passion Sunday, Easter, Ascension,
 Pentecost, Trinity, John the Baptist, Visitation, Mary Magdalen, Transfiguration,
 and Angels.  Each mass is preceded by a title in large capital letters (with the
 masses for the Visitation and Mary Magdalen combined under one title, since they
 share the same introit), and the beginnings of pieces and verses are set off with
 large capitals.  There is an index on the verso of the first (unnumbered) folio
 that lists and numbers the masses and gives the beginning folio number for each
 of them.  The manuscript is written in a neat (though not formal) hand.</p>

Ms. 8, in contrast, looks like (and may have been) a draft for ms. 24.  It is
 written by several scribes in a more casual style and copied in a relatively
 disorganized order.
 After several unrelated opening numbers it begins with a mass for Trinity
 Sunday that includes an introit by Conrad Rein, an alleluia, and a sequence
 that is missing its last verse.  Masses for John the Baptist and the Visitation
 & Mary Magdalen follow in liturgical order, and then a new series begins with
 Christmas and continues through Epiphany, Purification, Advent, Easter, Ascension,
 Pentecost, Transfiguration, and Angels.  This second series is in liturgical
 order except for Advent; the Advent music consists only of an introit that is
 assigned to the Annunciation in <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>, and thus falls
 between Purification and Easter in that source.  After the second series there
 is another mass for Trinity, this time with an introit by Isaac, and the final
 verse of the sequence that was left incomplete in the previous Trinity mass.
 The sequence for Ascension is completely scrambled: its verses are written in an
 apparently random order, and four verses appear after the music for Pentecost.
 The labels for feasts are squeezed awkwardly into empty spaces in the margins
 or above the staves, with no extra space allowed for them.  The disorderly
 features of this manuscript are not a result of the pages having been assembled
 incorrectly, since the second series begins on the same page where the first series
 ends.  The scribes must have copied each verse into all of the partbooks before
 moving to the next verse, since the scrambled order of the verses of the Ascension
 sequence is the same in all partbooks.</p>

The <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> repertoire in ms. 8 is not simply copied, but
 substantially adapted to suit the requirements of the church of St. Aegidius
 in Bártfa.  Seven numbers were assigned to different liturgical feasts than those
 to which they belong in <i>Choralis II</i>, and three of them were supplied with
 new texts in the process:</p>

<ul><li>Circumcision introit assigned to Visitation & Mary Magdalen</li>
    <li>Circumcision alleluia assigned to Visitation (with new words)</li>
    <li>Circumcision sequence assigned to Purification</li>
    <li>Annunciation introit assigned to Advent</li>
    <li>Annunciation tract assigned to Purification</li>
    <li>Pentecost sequence assigned to Ascension (with new words)</li>
    <li>Mary Magdalen sequence assigned to John the Baptist (with new words)</li></ul>

In addition, four numbers with unchanged liturgical assignments were supplied with second (alternative
 or additional) texts:</p>

<ul><li>Epiphany sequence: second text added to verse 12</li>
    <li>Easter introit: text of second cantus firmus changed from Latin to German</li>
    <li>Pentecost introit: second text added</li>
    <li>John the Baptist introit: second text added</li></ul>

These liturgical and textual alterations apply to all of the manuscripts in the
 Bártfa family.</p>

The above relationships may be seen in the following table.  All of the propers
 that appear in both  ms. 8 and ms. 24 are listed.  The order follows ms. 24,
 with folio numbers in the discant partbook given for both manuscripts.  (Folio numbers
 vary slightly among the partbooks.)  Pieces in ms. 24 that do not have counterparts
 in <i>Choralis Constantinus</i> are summarized in parentheses.  All propers are by Isaac and found in
 <i>Choralis I</i> or <i>II</i> unless a different composer is identified.  
 Sequences are identified by their first polyphonic verses.</p>

Ms. 8 was copied from a copy of the printer’s exemplar in an earlier state than other copies based on the
 same source.  It has most, but not all, of the complex mensuration and proportion signs that Sebald
 Heyden evidently imposed on Isaac's notation in the process of preparing the music for publication.</p>


Ms. 24 must have been copied directly from ms. 8.  It puts the music in proper order, but retains
 virtually all of the errors
 and variants in ms 8 while adding some more of its own.  There was probably no intermediate copy between
 ms. 8 and ms. 24, because many of the errors in ms. 24 appear in places where the notation in ms. 8 is
 ambiguous (e.g., where a note is placed where it is not clear whether it is on a line or in a space).
 Sequence 7, which is not found in m. 8, was copied from the same source as ms. 8.
 The date of the relevant section of ms. 24 is unknown, but it is likely to be not much later than ms. 8,
 since ms. 24 is the source that makes the material in ms. 8 usable for practical purposes.<p>   

The second section of ms. 24 is independent and substantially later.
