<b><i>Choralis Constantinus II</i> contents</b> (D only):</p>

Ms. Pr. 1 is an elegant manuscript that is bound together with RISM 1545/5.  
 It features a decorated capital at the beginning of each mass, with especially
 elaborate ones for Christmas and Easter.</p>

The manuscript consists of three distinct sections.  The first begins with an
 anonymous mass ordinary followed by ten numbers from <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>
 (plus an additional Isaac piece substituting for one of the <i>Choralis</i> numbers)
 and an Isaac mass.  The Isaac numbers in this section are:</p>

<ul><li>Introit-Puer natus (fol. 5r) [Christmas]</li>
<li>Alleluia-Dies sanctificatus (fol. 5v) [Christmas]</li>
<li>Sequence-Grates nunc (a non-<i>Choralis</i> setting by Isaac; fol. 6r) [Christmas]</li>
<li>Introit-Ecce advenit (fol. 7r) [Epiphany]</li>
<li>Alleluia-Vidimus stellam (fol. 7v) [Epiphany]</li>
<li>Sequence-Quae miris (fol. 8r) [Epiphany]</li>
<li>Introit-Suscepimus (fol. 9r) [Purification]</li>
<li>Sequence-Regem regum (fol. 9v) [Purification]</li>
<li>Tract-Ave Maria (fol. 10v) [Purification]</li>
<li>Introit-Rorate coeli (fol. 11v) [Advent]</li>
<li>Introit-Resurrexi (fol. 12r) [Easter]</li>
<li>Missa paschale-Kyrie (fol. 12v) [Easter]</li></ul></p>

The musical and textual readings of the <i>Choralis II</i> pieces in this group
 correspond to those in mss. 8 and 24.   The pieces were copied from a
 manuscript in the Bártfa set, most likely ms. 8 or ms. 24.  (In the
 very few instances in which readings differ between those sources, ms. Pr. 1 agrees sometimes
 with one and sometimes with the other.)  The Isaac Kyrie in this set also appears
 among the Easter pieces in both ms. 8 and ms. 24.</p>

Liturgical assignments are not specified in the manuscript, but the implied assignments
 agree with those in mss. 8 and 24.  Christmas, Epiphany, and Easter are unproblematic 
 The sequence Regem regum and the tract Ave Maria  belong implicitly in the Purification
 group (rather than with Circumcision and Annunciation, respectively, as in <i>Choralis II</i>).
 The introit Rorate coeli is assigned to Advent in both ms. 8 and ms. 24, though it is
 placed between Purification and Easter in ms. 8 (as in the <i>Choralis II</i> print, where it
 belongs in the Annunciation group).</p>

The second section of the manuscript includes a variety of liturgical numbers by more
 recent composers.  It features a note after the end of a piece on fol. 29r that reads:
 “Scripsit haec Johannes Frisch manus Norimberg, Anno 1610, 9 Novem[bris]” (Murámyi,
 p. XXX).  It is hard to imagine that this note applies to the opening Isaac group,
 since there is no apparent reason that one of the Bártfa sources would have been
 in Nuremberg at that time.  The note presumably applies only to the second group, which
 may originally have been a separate manuscript.  That group begins on a new folio
 in the only surviving partbook.  If the second section was copied independently of
 the first, its date implies nothing about the date of copying of the first section.</p>

The third section of the manuscript, following the above note (on the same page),
 contains music from Michael Praetorius’s <i>Missodia Sionia</i>, which was published in 1611.
