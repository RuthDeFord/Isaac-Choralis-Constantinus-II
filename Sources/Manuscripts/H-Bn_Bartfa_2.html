<b>Choralis Constantinus II contents</b> (A, T, B only):</p>

Ms. 2 consists of two distinct sections (labeled “Koll. 1" and “Koll. 2" in
 Murányi’s catalogue).  The first section contains mass propers and miscellaneous
 pieces for the period from Advent through Easter.  The feasts are not labeled.
 This section includes the following pieces from <i>Choralis Constantinus II</i>:</p>

<ul><li>Introit-Rorate coeli (no. 1) {Advent]</li>
<li>Introit-Puer natus (no. 3) [Christmas]</li>
<li>Alleluia-Dies sanctificatus (no. 5) [Christmas]</li>
<li>Introit-Ecce advenit (no. 10) [Epiphany]</li>
<li>Introit-Suscipimus (no. 11) [Purification]</li>
<li>Alleluia-Pascha nostrum (unnumbered) [Easter]</li></ul></p>

The second section contains much later repertoire.  The latest piece in it was
 printed in 1623.</p>

Based on the pattern of variants, the manuscript appears to have been copied from
 ms. 24 or a copy of it.</p>

According to Murányi, the manuscript is mostly in the hand of Zacharias Zarewutius
 (1605-67).  Zarewutius was the copyist of H-Bn MS Bártfa Mus.1, which has a date
 of 1 September 1665 (pp. XXI-XXII).  If he copied both sections of ms. 2, as he
 appears to have done, some of the pieces from <i>Choralis II</i> must still have
 been of interest in Bártfa until well into the seventeenth century.  Whether this
 interest was purely historical, or whether the pieces were still in the active
 performance repertoire, cannot be determined.
