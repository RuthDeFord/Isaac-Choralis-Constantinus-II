The copyist Johann Buchmayer, who was originally from Nuremberg, was also a composer.
 His works occupy nearly half of MS C 100. He had a habit of modifying works of other
 composers that he copied, in particular by filling in thinly-textured passages with
 additional voices.  That procedure is evident in mm. 7-8, where a two-voice passage
 is rewritten to include all four voices.  The other musical variants in his copy, though
 relatively numerous, are minor differences in pitch and rhythm of the types that are
 common in many sources.</p>
