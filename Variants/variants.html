<h1>Variants</h1>

The catalogue of variants below lists differences between the sources and the
edition by Source, Piece, Voice, Location (verse [if applicable], measure number,
and note number), Reading, Type, and Subtype.  If verse is not specified,
the variant applies to the first section of Introits and Alleluias.<p>

Differences among the sources are reported as variants, with the following exceptions:<p>

<ul><li>Differences in coloration are not reported.</li>

<li>Differences in chant incipits are reported only for the <i>Choralis II</i> print.
 Incipits in other sources often correspond to local versions of chants and differ in minor ways
 from those in the edition.</li>

<li>Differences in text underlay are reported only if the apparently intended underlay
 differs from that in the edition. Phrases without text are assumed to
 call for either a repeat or an extension of the preceding text.  The Underlay
 subtype "No text" is specified only when the implied text differs from that in the edition.</li>

<li>Differences in text repetitions, which are often
 ambiguous in the sources, are reported only for the <i>Choralis II</i> print.
 Text repetitions called for in the print that are omitted in the edition are
 reported as variants.  Text repetitions that are added editorially
 are in italics.</li></ul><p>

Errors corrected in-house are not included. They are listed under 
 <a href="../Sources/Formschneider/In-house_corrections.html">in-house corrections</a>.<p>

The editors have attempted to distinguish between variants and errors in all applicable categories.
 There are cases where this distinction is not clear, however, and the assigned category is a
 matter of judgment.<p>
