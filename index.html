Heinrich Isaac (c. 1450/55-1517) was one of the most outstanding and prolific composers
 of his generation. His career profile was also among the most distinctive, with periods
  in service not only of the Medici in Florence but also at the Habsburg court of Emperor
   Maximilian I in Austria. The New Isaac Edition presents this composer’s output following
    up-to-date critical scholarly principles and using the newest research.</p>

The second volume of Isaac’s monumental posthumous mass proper collection known as the
 Choralis Constantinus contains twenty-five cycles for the most important church feasts,
  including Easter and Christmas. The present edition supersedes the previous complete one,
   which Anton von Webern prepared over a century ago. Based on a vastly expanded number
    of sources, it sheds new light on the publication history and transmission of Isaac's
     materials. Uniquely, the edition includes chant supplements not contained in the
      original sources, but which are necessary for complete performances of the pieces.
       The complete chant cantus firmi are presented in a comprehensive appendix.</p>
